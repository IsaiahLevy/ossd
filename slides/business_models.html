## [4 successful open source business models to consider](https://opensource.com/article/17/12/open-source-business-models) by Daniel Rubinstein


--

- Support and services
- Advertisement partnerships
- Paid additional features (a.k.a., open core)
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)


---

## Open core

The idea is to keep two _versions_ of the software:
- provide the core of the project as open source
- keep addons, customizations, improvements as proprietary

--

Form [Musings on open source software business models](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html)
is  an article by Tom Callaway:

>The purpose of the proprietary software is to improve the usability of the open source “core”, and the business model is structured around the belief that customers want to use the “core” but get value from the usability wrapper. In other cases, there is a proprietary fork of an open source core, which contains extra features not found in the “core”.

# Software Consulting

- provide consulting to other businesses regarding the use of open source in
their daily operations
- provide consultation for starting and running an open source project

---

# Subscription Offerings

- provide services that accompany the software that is otherwise
available to anyone who wants it
- examples of such services:
    - installation
    - maintenance
    - training
    - localization
    - day to day support

---

#  Donations

- provide the software or service and encourage donations
- sell products branded with the company name

Examples:
- [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) - collection of web-tools, 
[How Does Mozilla Make Money? Mozilla Business Model Analysis](https://fourweekmba.com/how-does-mozilla-make-money/)
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) - open encyclopedia


---
# Software as a Service (SaaS)

- customers subscribe to an online service (the software running there
is open source, but it is the service that generates revenue)

- started as a result of industry frustration with _commercial off-the-shelf_ (COTS) software
that was hosted on premises and managed by local IT

- frequent overlap with open core model (i.e., companies can do both)

Examples:
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
- [Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

---

# Dual Licensing / Selling Exceptions

- software is available under the open source license,
- exceptions to that license are made (for a fee) to allow
a third party company to use it under different rules

Examples:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) - database
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - database




---
# Peace of Mind

- acting as a middle-men between the company consuming the open source software
and the open source project itself
  - charge the consumer in exchange for guarantees that the project will be supported
  and will continue development
  - support the open source project (financially)


---

# Bounty driven development

- third party companies using the open source software
pay to have the bugs fixed and new features implemented

Examples:
- [Caprine](https://sindresorhus.com/caprine/)

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors)
