# Course Description
---
**Open Source Software Development**

This course prepares students to become active participants in open source projects. It begins with an overview of the philosophy and brief history of open source development, followed by an in-depth look at different types of open source projects and the study of various tools involved in open source development. In particular, it covers the collaborative nature of open source projects, community structure, version control systems, licensing, intellectual property, types of contributions (programming and non-programming) and the tool-chains that enable such contributions.

__The students are expected to contribute to existing open source projects.__


## Objectives and Outcomes

The objectives and outcomes are explained in the course syllabus. The objectives are repeated here. Students who successfully complete this course:
-   will be able to explain to others the nature of open source software, particularly how it differs from proprietary software;
-   will be able to evaluate open source software projects with respect to their maturity, level of activity, community friendliness, and complexity;
-   will be able to find suitable open source software projects in which to participate;
-   will become a contributing member of a software development community;
-   will be able to choose an appropriate license for their creative works in general and to explain what can and cannot be done with software that has a specific license;
-   will be able to explain how software licensing works in general, what choices of license exist; and
-   will be able to give several examples of the ways in which companies earn money in the open source ecosystem.
