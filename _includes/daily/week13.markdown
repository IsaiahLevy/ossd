### Assignments

**Due by the end of Sunday (April 21)**

- Research an area (other than software) in which open source ideas are used. Add that 
topic and resources you found to the wiki page at [Open Source and ...](https://github.com/ossd-s24/wiki/wiki/Open-Source-and-...). On Monday, we will focus our discussion
on these different discoveries. 

- Make your blog post. Reflect on our discussion about the lessons from _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_. 
Was your choice of favorite lesson afected by the discussion and opinions voiced by other students in the class?  **Also** reflect on your group's progress. What are some challenges
that you (as a group) need to overcome? What are some challenges that you (as an individual) need to overcome?
