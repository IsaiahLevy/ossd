### Assignments


Make your blog post:
- reflect on the in-class discussion of open source within industry
- reflect on your group project work: what are your biggest accomplishements? what are the failures? what are 
some surprises (good or bad) about your project? 

Open source and ...
- _look around_ for uses of open source and open ideas in different areas
- find articles or examples of such uses
- add these resources to our course wiki on the page titled _Open Source and ..._  (if someone else found similar use of open source, you can add your resources and 
examples under the same heading) 
- be prepared to talk briefly about the areas and examples that you found 

Make sure all of your individual contributions are listed on your blog page. (Do not list your group project contributions there. These will be evaluated separately as part of your group project.)
