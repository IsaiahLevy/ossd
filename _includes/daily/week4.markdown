### Assignments

__Due by the end of the week__:
- Test out some of the add-on projects created by other teams. Report 
any issues you find. If you are interested in contributing to the project, reach out 
to its community to try to add features, fix issues, etc. 

- Make your blog post for the week
  - comment about your group work on the browser extension, did you learn anything 
  about yourself and how you are able to work with others? 
  - describe your own contributions to your team's efforts of building
  your browser extension
  - comment on new things you learned (tools, features of tools that you were not familiar with, etc) or
  learned about yourself (skills you realized you have, team work preferences and style, etc.)
  - comment on other teams presentations and their projects, did you have any favorites? 

__Due by the end of Tuesday (2/20)__: 

Watch one of the four video groups (you can watch more of them, but pick at least one). On the Wiki page labeled Social Good videos, put your name (first and last) under the group that you watched (again, you can put your name under more than one). We'll be talking about these in class next week. 

Group 1: 
  - [Opening the Loop. Autonomy, Access and Insulin](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/opening-the-loop)
  - [Healthcare Made Human](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/common-connections/healthcare-made-human)

Group 2: 
  - [Food Computer](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/farming-for-the-future/food-computer)
  - [Farming for the Future](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/farming-for-the-future)

Group 3: 
  - [Democratizing Knowledge in Higher Education](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/live-talk-democratizing-knowledge)
  - [Cracking the Textbook](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/cracking-the-textbook)

Group 4: 
  - [The Science of Collective Discovery](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/collective-discovery)
  - [Open Data in Chile](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/starting-small-open-data)
  


__Ongoing (but seems to be neglected by most)__:
- Make _small_ open source contributions. Refer back to [Contributions you should be working on, slides](slides/contributions.html)
from a couple of weeks ago for the types of contributions and the workflow for the course website contributions (use the same workflow if you wish to contribute to any of the add-on projects).<br/>
A few things to keep in mind:
- make sure links are clickable
- remove the _template_ line from the table of your contributions
- make sure your contributions are diverse, not targetting a single type (ex., only Wikipedia, or only course website)
